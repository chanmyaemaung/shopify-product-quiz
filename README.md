# Shopify Product Quiz Form (Without using Apps)

The goal of this quiz is to ask customers a series of questions and based on their answer recommend a pair of sunglasses for them which they can add with one click. The seven screens for the quiz will be:

## Instructions

1. What frame style do you prefer (5 options)

2. What color frames do you want? (3 or 2 depending on the frame selection)
3. Do you want polarized, non polarized, RX or blue blocking? (4 options)
4. If they select polarized or unpolarized, ask them what color they want. If they answer blue blockers skip to 5. If they select RX direct them to the product page with the first two options (frame and lens) selected.
5. What size is your face? (Would be great to use sizing guides here)
6. We got your custom pair of sunnies! Quick last question for you? Do you participate in any of the following activities? Kayaking, skiing, glacial stuff, stc.
7. Sweet, we think our side shields would be helpful for you. Yes, No Thank you, Change My Answers (links to the frame style pdp they picked). The rest add to cart w/ or without side shields and redirects to checkout.‚Äù
