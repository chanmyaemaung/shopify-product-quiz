# Shopify Recommend Product Quiz (Without using Apps)

I'd developed a quiz for Shopify store to recommend products to customers. The quiz is based on the customer's answers to the questions. The quiz is developed using Shopify's [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/). The quiz is developed without using any apps. It's a just simple quiz tha can be easily integrated into any Shopify store.
